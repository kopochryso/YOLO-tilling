# YOLO-label-tilling

As we know, training YOLO models with images of high resolution can be tricky, due to the loss of the labels' resolution.

Then tilling came to save the day, by cropping images in lower resolution with their according labels.

This script was based through the github rep of YOLO-tilling, with the help of ChatGPT.
